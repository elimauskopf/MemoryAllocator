My allocator works as such:
    - best fit, worst-fit, first fit are their own functions
    which find a node suitable in free and simply return it
    - my allocate function takes an int as a parameter to decide which
    strategy to use. Once a node is found from said strategy, using
    the functions described earlier I then add the node to allocated list
    and modify it in the free list

Deallocate:
    - Find the node in allocated list which has the same data as the paramater
    - add the node to free list
    - delete it from the allocated list
