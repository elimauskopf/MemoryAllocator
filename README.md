# MemoryAllocator

Cumulative lab for my operating systems class at Bucknell University. Given a few header files and methods containing 
basic linked list operations and a test file as a starting point, we were tasked with modeling a memory allocator in C using linked lists. 
The allocator implements best fit, worst-fit, and first models of memory allocation.
