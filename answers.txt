1. Doubly linked lists are suitable because they allow for quick insertion or deletion in spots besides the head and tail. This is important because in a custom memory allocator there is no guarantee new memory will be allocated at the head or tail.
2. A stack can be used as we can push to the stack when we need to put things in memory and pop when we need to free
3. external fragmentation is when there is free space left in memory after is a process is removed. The result is a lot memory that processes can not use because it is not contigous.
4. Internal fragmentation is when a lot of memory is lost because a process is assigned to a block of memory that is larger than the process needs. The memory not used by the process becomes fragmented.
5. First fit policy is when we use the first block of memory that fits of our needs. Pro: fastest time to find memory block. Con: can end up wasting a lot of memory
6. Best fit policy is when we find the block of memory that is closest in size to the amount of memory we need to allocate. Pro: it wastes the least memory. Con: It takes more time to find the right slot in memory.
7. Worst fit policy is when we find the largest block of memory to use. Pro: The memory not used up by each allocation is larger and has more potential for future use. Con: Can end up wasting a lot of memory and leave us with no memory for processes that requrie a lot of memory.
